# Sensory-Conflict-in-Nematostella-vectensis

This repo contains the code used for the manuscript "Sensory conflict disrupts circadian rhythms in the sea anemone
_Nematostella vectensis_" by Berger & Tarrant (2022) (doi:xxx). The code is commented but not beautiful, and you will need to modify relative paths to run on another machine.

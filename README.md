# Sensory-Conflict-in-Nematostella-vectensis

This repo contains the R code used for the manuscript "Sensory conflict disrupts circadian rhythms in the sea anemone
_Nematostella vectensis_" by Berger & Tarrant (2022) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.11.487933). The code is commented but not beautiful, and you will need to modify relative paths to run on another machine.

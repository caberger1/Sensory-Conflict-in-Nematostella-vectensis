# Sensory-Conflict-in-Nematostella-vectensis

This repo contains the R code used for the manuscript "Sensory conflict disrupts circadian rhythms in the sea anemone
_Nematostella vectensis_" by Berger & Tarrant (2022) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.11.487933). The code is commented but not beautiful. All of the data needed to repeat these analyses is in the Supplemental Material of the paper, and the most important parts are also uploaded to this repo, but you will need to modify paths, and perhaps other parts of the code, in order to run on another machine.
